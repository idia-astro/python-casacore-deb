python-casacore for Debian

This package has been rebuilt against a custom packaged version of casacore 
created for the CARTA project, which also includes the CASA image analysis 
module. This package is not a dependency of CARTA, but is needed to resolve an 
indirect dependency of the default Ubuntu package of casacore-data.
